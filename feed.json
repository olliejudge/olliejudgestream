My company makes podcasts, videos and entertainment products, and nine times out of ten, I’m going to need some kind of web server to distribute our content. On a daily basis we use content management systems, file sharing, version control systems and project planning software. As the company has grown so have our requirements of the technology we use. Gone are the days where you can just bend Wordpress into a strange shape to build whatever system you need. While we’re still largely using off the shelf open source tech, our needs have gone beyond the shared web host or a collection of VPS’, and as the pandemic set in, we needed to make sure that our creators and clients could get what they needed, when they needed it.</p>\n\n<p>So begun my adventure into trying to centralise our infrastructure in one place and trying to get my head round product names, pricing and what any of this is good for.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"just-use-what-you-know\">Just Use What You Know</h2>\n\n<p>After asking a few technical friends, the overwhelming advice was “just use what you know”. Well I didn’t really know any cloud environments, what I did know was Ubuntu. So my first port of call was to just look into VPS like systems on Digital Ocean and Linode.</p>\n\n<p>This started off great, I had a bunch of machines, that I could manage. There were no weird bandwidth pricing calculations just good old fashioned Ubuntu on a server. We use Ghost quite a bit, this ran well, and we were able to spin up all the right things like version control and file sharing on separate linux machines.</p>\n\n<p>Then things started to get unwieldy. We had a bunch of linux machines, sort of haphazardly put together, with all kinds of fun names, with varying levels of patching and software updates. I attempted to pull this together with Landscape and Cockpit. At this point configuration was getting a bit overwhelming, I started looking into Ansible and Terraform as a bit of a desperate attempt to create something cohesive, which is when we started to notice some cracks in our VPS ocean.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cdn-s-and-quality-of-life\">CDN’s and Quality Of Life</h2>\n\n<p>As a media company, we make content. Lots of it. There are drafts, finals and usually these are all fairly big files. The VPS providers have some great plans with terabytes of transfer built in at a baseline level, which makes them very attractive to a person like me. What we quickly found out though was without a decent CDN and the right tools to manage our files things got slow and difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Back to the start I’m not a developer, and right now I can’t learn to be one. I needed infrastructure that could almost run itself, and do it well. VPS updates and management were out of control, and as much as I love Digital Ocean, their solutions to CDN’s aren’t great. This is when I started to look at the other clouds in the room, all of which seemed to have products that did one thing well. From extensive CDN’s, to managed databases and more robust storage systems. It was going to cost a bit more, but the allure of having infrastructure built and managed by people who knew what they were doing and kept it up to date meant the world. So I started poking around the bigger platforms.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"kubernetes-and-containers-the-great-distraction\">Kubernetes and Containers - The Great Distraction</h2>\n\n<p>You can’t get more than two sentences in to a cloud offering without a mention of Kubernetes.
