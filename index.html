         	<p>Fianc√©‚Äôs birthday supper came out rather amazingly. If you can the feast box from Norma London is fantastic.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>For the past little while I&rsquo;ve been playing around with static site generators and different systems for my website. I&rsquo;ve wanted to adopt an <a href="https://brianlovin.com/overthought/incrementally-correct-personal-websites">incrementally correct</a> website since I read Brian Lovin&rsquo;s post, but just couldn&rsquo;t find a process that worked for me.</p>

<p>I rediscovered <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, which feels like all the things I liked about the fancy generator world with less of the mental backflip of Git pushes and maintaining dependencies. So I&rsquo;ve moved my site over, and I&rsquo;m quite looking forward to sharing the little and big things I&rsquo;ve been working on.</p>

<p>Still fixing styling bugs and a few formatting issues, but I feel this might be the best fit for me to keep things a little bit more updated on a regular basis.</p>
